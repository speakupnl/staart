# Approve this login in {{location}}

Dear {{name}},

Someone tried to log in to your account from {{location}}. If this was you, you can approve this login and we'll remember this location.

<a style="background: #3f51b5; padding: 1rem 2rem; font-size: 120%; color: #fff; display: inline-block; margin: 2rem auto; border-radius: 0.25rem" href="{{frontendUrl}}/auth/token?subject=approve-location&token={{token}}">Approve this login</a>

If this wasn't you, maybe someone else is trying to log in to your account. You should definitely change your password if that's the case.
